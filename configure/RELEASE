# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES to this file you must subsequently
# do a "gnumake rebuild" in this application's top level
# directory.
#
# The build process does not check dependencies against files
# that are outside this application, thus you should do a
# "gnumake rebuild" in the top level directory after EPICS_BASE
# or any other external module pointed to below is rebuilt.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)
#
# This file should ONLY define paths to other support modules,
# or include statements that pull in similar RELEASE files.
# Build settings that are NOT module paths should appear in a
# CONFIG_SITE file.

## (Optional) Local build of libevent2 for debugging
## If LIBEVENT is not defined, then the system version is used (eg. /usr/lib)
#LIBEVENT=/path/to/libevent2

## (Optional) Source from the lwip and lwip-contrib release/repositories
## If defined, then the targetApp examples will be built for Linux
#LWIP=/home/mdavidsaver/source/lwip
#LWIP_CONTRIB=/home/mdavidsaver/source/lwip-contrib

# EPICS_BASE usually appears last so other apps can override stuff:
#EPICS_BASE=/usr/lib/epics

# Set RULES here if you want to take build rules from somewhere
# other than EPICS_BASE:
#RULES=/path/to/epics/support/module/rules/x-y
